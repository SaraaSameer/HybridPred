## Description

Accurately measuring the cycle lifetime of a commercial lithium-ion battery is crucial for performance and technology development in electric vehicles. In this project we introduce a novel approach combining a physics-based equation with a self-attention model to predict the cycle lifetimes of commercial lithium iron phosphate graphite cells via early-cycle data. Fitting capacity curves to this physics-based equation, we then use a self-attention layer to reconstruct entire battery capacity curves. Our model exhibits comparable performances to existing models while predicting the entire capacity curve instead of cycle life. This combines the advantages of data-driven architectures with physics-informed features to give a more complete description of the behavior of complex battery systems.
